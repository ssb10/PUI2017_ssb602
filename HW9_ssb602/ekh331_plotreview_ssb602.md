The plot gives a clear distinction between bus, train and total ridership due to good colour choice. Also, the grid helps in reading the plot easily. The axis labels, legend and title is perfect!

Though line plot speaks a lot about CTA ridership, since it is a comparison, I think bar plot would have been a better choice.

It is mentioned in the caption that there was decrease in ridership first and then a increase, I think this change should have been marked clearly on the line plot so that it can be spotted in the first glance. That is why again bar plot would have been better.

I asked to comment explicitly on clarity, esthetics, and honesty. You are giving suggestions and have a few comments but it is not sure what affests and refers to what. 

I am not sure why you suggest a bar plot. This is a time series, and the best way to visualize trents in time i sthrouhg line plots (remember our discussion about graphical elements): it enables comoparison as well as understanding of the whole time series at a glance, while bars are interpreted as individual element and that global understanding is harder.
