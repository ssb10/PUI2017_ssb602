The plot gives a clear distinction between bus, train and total ridership due to good colour choice. Also, the grid helps in reading the plot easily. The axis labels, legend and title is perfect!

Though line plot speaks a lot about CTA ridership, since it is a comparison, I think bar plot would have been a better choice.

It is mentioned in the caption that there was decrease in ridership first and then a increase, I think this change should have been marked clearly on the line plot so that it can be spotted in the first glance. That is why again bar plot would have been better.
