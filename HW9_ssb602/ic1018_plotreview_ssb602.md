The plot is really a good one showing air quality index for Hongkong. The gradient effect helps in easily understanding the change in air quality index over time. Also, I have observed that as the air quality worsens the color becomes darker, a shade of maroon which definitely emphasizes the threat to health.The scale given to Air Quality index further helps in understanding the graph. The axis labels, title and legend is perfect!

Initially looking at the plot, I thought that there is some new library I might get to look at. But to my surprise this was made using matplotlib only! This is really impressive.

The only thing I would I like to change is removing the daily max strip at the top. It may be confused with theday of the hour. The daily max should have been plotted after a certian gap so that it is separated from the day of the hour.

Another suggestion is about the caption. I think it is a bit too descriptive.
