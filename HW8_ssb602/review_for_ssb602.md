**CLARITY**

The plot is clear and easy to read. It shows the restaurant grades and the violations in five boroughs. The x and y axis labels and title show the content of the plot properly.

Maybe provide some brief information about what is critical and uncritical violations in caption will make it more clear about the meaning of the plot.

**AESTHETIC**

The color and layout of the plot are well chosen. Different colormaps are chosen for the counts of grade and critical flag. Transparency level is set when layering two bar plots. The grid of the background helps to read the value.

Bar plot is appropriately chosen to display values in different categories, which in this case is the five boroughs. At first glance, layering unstack bar plot and stack bar plot together is a little bit distracting to me. One alternative is to show the critical flag counts in each grade separately. We can also know how many restaurants in each grade have critical violation that way. 

**HONESTY**

The plot honestly reports the dataset chosen. There is no distortion of the data. However, plotting the total value of the restaurants with different grades in five boroughs do not give much information. Percentage values of restaurants with different grades in each borough can be added to compare with each other.
